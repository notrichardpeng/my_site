    To check if a one-directional graph is 
    fully connected: select one node, then see 
    if every other node can be reached from that 
    node and vice versa. This can be done more 
    easily by reversing the one directional edges 
    and doing DFS from the selected node, instead 
    of doing a DFS for every other node.

    Consider sorting by Ending Time when it comes 
    to scheduling problems. Also consider sorting 
    by the length of duration.

    Break problems down into a number of 
    scenarios, and think about them 
    individually (Codeforces Ciel and duel).
